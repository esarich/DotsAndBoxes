The purpose of this project was to create an object-oriented game that could be played as a java applet.
We chose to create the game called "Dots and Boxes", where two players draw lines between a grid of boxes,
competing to complete a four-sided square. The player who draws the fourth side of a box gets a point, and
an additional turn. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game is the winner.
